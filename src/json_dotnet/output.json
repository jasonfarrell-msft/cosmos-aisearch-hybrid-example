Please provide a narrative description of your process and solution(s).\n\n\n\nIssuing Company's Response\n\n\nFor 4-12kV planning, Ameren uses an in house developed program called Load Analysis. Load analysis holds all normal and emergency ratings for every substation transformer and feeder. After each summer or winter season, the peak temperature day is identified and the loading data for all feeders and substation is pulled out of our SCADA historian for that day. That data is then pushed into Load Analysis. The Engineer inputs the expected load growth, DER penetration, future projects, and other diversions on each feeder and substation into Load Analysis. A report is then generated that shows every feeder and substation load projection for the next 5 years.The distribution load projections are then summed up to the sub-transmission level (34-69kV) and put into PSS/E. The engineer runs PSS/E power flow analysis and manually inputs the resulting load projections for the next 5 years onto an excel spreadsheet.",

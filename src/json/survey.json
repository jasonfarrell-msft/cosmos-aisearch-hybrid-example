    "How do you validate the security of container images before deploying them?\n\n\n\nIssuing Company's Response\n\n\nCon Edison leverages Microsoft Defender for container scanning. We are also conducting a POC with Prisma for container scanning. Our planned process is to not allow images with critical or high vulnerabilities to be moved into production. \n\n\n\n": "TVA does not use container security scanning on premise, but does leverage CrowdStrike in active mode with Microsoft Defender in passive mode. TVA also deploys Nessus agents that report vulnerabilities back to Tenable.IO.   TVA does leverage Azure Defender for Containers with provisioning Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). AKS patches weekly where there is an approved vendor fix. TVA relies on the CSPs (Azure/AWS) to remediate vulnerabilities based on the FedRAMP requirements. For AWS Containers, AWS is responsible for maintaining the Elastic Container Service infrastructure.",
